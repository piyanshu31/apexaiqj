## Introduction to ApexaiQ
**Maintain a pristine, verifiable inventory.** Focus on critical priorities, manage your attack surface, understand your vulnerabilities, and respond decisively.

### Understanding IT Asset Management (ITAM)
IT Asset Management encompasses the complete lifecycle management of an organization's technological resources—from initial deployment and active maintenance to eventual retirement and disposal. 
* **Defining Assets**: In the IT realm, assets represent any valuable hardware, software applications, or proprietary data.

By strictly governing every phase of an asset's lifespan, organizations gain full visibility into the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and can maximize the value derived from their technological investments.

### Why Asset Management is Critical
A robust asset management strategy drives several key business outcomes:
* **Maximizes Resource Efficiency**: Eradicates digital waste by ensuring all current assets are utilized optimally.
* **Drives Uninterrupted Productivity**: Empowers the workforce to operate smoothly while maintaining high system dependability.
* **Curbs Unnecessary Spending**: Cuts down on financial bloat by identifying and eliminating idle instances, over-allocated resources, and unnecessary licensing.

### Core Phases of the ITAM Lifecycle
A standard asset management framework consists of these foundational steps:
1. **Asset Discovery & Logging**: Creating a comprehensive registry of all hardware and software.
2. **TCO Calculation**: Assessing the financial impact of an asset from purchase to decommissioning.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Keeping a close eye on the location, health, and utilization rates of your inventory.
4. **Upkeep & Patching**: Guaranteeing systems remain updated, secure, and operational throughout their lifecycle.
5. **Budgeting & Forecasting**: Strategizing for future hardware refreshes, software renewals, and overall IT spending.

### Some terminologies 

1. **Agentless Platform**: Agentless security is a technique that secures networks and endpoints without the need for software agents. By leveraging existing infrastructure and protocols, agentless security provides a holistic view of the network, enabling better threat detection and response.

2. **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** A formal contract that defines
expected service performance (uptime, response time, resolution time)
between a service provider and customer.

3. **Obsolescence**: The process of becoming out of date, no longer in general use or no longer useful is known as Obsolescence.

4. **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Security technology that
continuously monitors endpoints (laptops, servers, etc.) to detect,
investigate, and respond to threats.

5. **Missles (Likely "Misconfigurations" --- confirm):** Security
weaknesses caused by improper system or application configuration.

6. **ITSM (IT Service Management):** The set of processes and tools used to
design, deliver, manage, and improve IT services within an organization.

7. **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Framework of policies and
technologies that ensures the right individuals have appropriate access
to technology resources.

8. **HDAR (Host Detection and Response --- confirm term):** Security
capability focused on monitoring and responding to threats at the host
level.

9. **Vulnerability Scanners (Common Types):** - Network‑based scanners -
Host‑based scanners - Web application scanners - Cloud security
scanners - Container security scanners

10. **Tenant:** A logically isolated customer environment within a
multi‑tenant platform.

11. **MTTTR (Mean Time To Remediate/Repair):** Average time taken to fix or
remediate identified vulnerabilities or incidents.

12. **Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a system, whether in hardware or software, that can be exploited by attackers to compromise security.

13. **Vulnerability Types in Companies:** - Misconfigurations - Outdated
software / missing patches - Weak authentication - Exposed services -
Zero‑day vulnerabilities - Compliance violations

14. **Asset Hygiene**: Asset Hygiene refers to the continuous process of maintaining the health, security and visibility of all hardware and software assets within an organization's IT environment.

15. **Crown Jewel**: It refers to an organization's most valuable and critical data, assets and systems. These are the assets that if compromised , would cause most significant damage to the business.

16. **NVD**: The NVD(National Vulnerability Database) provides the essential intelligence that powers the tools and processes organizations use to protect their systems from known security threats.

17. **Patch Management**: Patch management is the process that companies use to manage and deploy software updates, known as patches, to their systems.

18. *Network protocols**: Network protocols are sets of rules that govern how data is exchanged between devices on a network.
      - **Internet Protocol (IP)**: **IP** is the principal protocol for routing traffic across the internet. Its main job is to handle the addressing of devices.
      - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: TCP works hand-in-hand with IP. Its primary role is to ensure the **reliable, ordered, and error-checked** delivery of data.
      - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: UDP is another protocol that **works with IP**, but it's much simpler and faster than TCP.
      - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: It adds a layer of encryption using **SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).

19. . **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)**: SOAR stands for **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response**.
      - **Alert:** An email security tool detects a potential phishing email and sends an alert.
      - **Orchestration:** The SOAR platform receives the alert and pulls in related information from other tools. It checks the sender's reputation from a threat intelligence feed, examines the email attachment in a sandbox, and scans the suspicious link with a URL analysis tool.
      - **Automation:** Based on its playbook, the SOAR platform automatically performs several actions:
         - It searches all employee inboxes for similar emails and deletes them.
         - It blocks the sender's IP address on the firewall.
         - It adds the malicious link to a blocklist.
      - **Response:** The SOAR platform creates an incident ticket, logs all the automated actions, and presents a complete report to the security analyst. The analyst can then quickly verify the actions, add notes, and officially close the incident.
      
20. **Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM)**: CAASM is an emerging approach in cybersecurity that helps organizations see and manage their entire collection of digital assets to identify security gaps and reduce their attack surface.

21.  **Crawl job**: A crawl job is a task given to an automated program, called a crawler or spider, to systematically browse and index content on the internet or within a specific network.
