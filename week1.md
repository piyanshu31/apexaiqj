### IT asset Management
- Process of ensuring an organization's assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded and disposed of when time comes.
- Assets: IT asset includes hardware, software systems or information on organization values.
- An important part of IT asset management is applying process across all lifecycle stages to understand the total cost of ownership and optimize the use of assets.

### Importance of Asset Management
- Improving utilization and eliminating waste.
- Enabling productivity without compromising reliability.
- Reduce excess consumption including overprovisioning and idle instances, avoiding unnecessary costs

### IT Asset Managment Process
- Inventory assets
- Calculate lifecycle costs
- Tracking
- Maintenance
- Financial Planning

### Some terminologies 

1. **Agentless Platform**: Agentless security is a technique that secures networks and endpoints without the need for software agents. By leveraging existing infrastructure and protocols, agentless security provides a holistic view of the network, enabling better threat detection and response.

2. **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** A formal contract that defines
expected service performance (uptime, response time, resolution time)
between a service provider and customer.

3. **Obsolescence**: The process of becoming out of date, no longer in general use or no longer useful is known as Obsolescence.

4. **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Security technology that
continuously monitors endpoints (laptops, servers, etc.) to detect,
investigate, and respond to threats.

5. **Missles (Likely "Misconfigurations" --- confirm):** Security
weaknesses caused by improper system or application configuration.

6. **ITSM (IT Service Management):** The set of processes and tools used to
design, deliver, manage, and improve IT services within an organization.

7. **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Framework of policies and
technologies that ensures the right individuals have appropriate access
to technology resources.

8. **HDAR (Host Detection and Response --- confirm term):** Security
capability focused on monitoring and responding to threats at the host
level.

9. **Vulnerability Scanners (Common Types):** - Network‑based scanners -
Host‑based scanners - Web application scanners - Cloud security
scanners - Container security scanners

10. **Tenant:** A logically isolated customer environment within a
multi‑tenant platform.

11. **MTTTR (Mean Time To Remediate/Repair):** Average time taken to fix or
remediate identified vulnerabilities or incidents.

12. **Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a system, whether in hardware or software, that can be exploited by attackers to compromise security.

13. **Vulnerability Types in Companies:** - Misconfigurations - Outdated
software / missing patches - Weak authentication - Exposed services -
Zero‑day vulnerabilities - Compliance violations

14. **Asset Hygiene**: Asset Hygiene refers to the continuous process of maintaining the health, security and visibility of all hardware and software assets within an organization's IT environment.

15. **Crown Jewel**: It refers to an organization's most valuable and critical data, assets and systems. These are the assets that if compromised , would cause most significant damage to the business.

16. **NVD**: The NVD(National Vulnerability Database) provides the essential intelligence that powers the tools and processes organizations use to protect their systems from known security threats.

17. **Patch Management**: Patch management is the process that companies use to manage and deploy software updates, known as patches, to their systems.

18. *Network protocols**: Network protocols are sets of rules that govern how data is exchanged between devices on a network.
      - **Internet Protocol (IP)**: **IP** is the principal protocol for routing traffic across the internet. Its main job is to handle the addressing of devices.
      - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: TCP works hand-in-hand with IP. Its primary role is to ensure the **reliable, ordered, and error-checked** delivery of data.
      - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: UDP is another protocol that **works with IP**, but it's much simpler and faster than TCP.
      - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: It adds a layer of encryption using **SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).

19. . **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)**: SOAR stands for **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response**.
      - **Alert:** An email security tool detects a potential phishing email and sends an alert.
      - **Orchestration:** The SOAR platform receives the alert and pulls in related information from other tools. It checks the sender's reputation from a threat intelligence feed, examines the email attachment in a sandbox, and scans the suspicious link with a URL analysis tool.
      - **Automation:** Based on its playbook, the SOAR platform automatically performs several actions:
         - It searches all employee inboxes for similar emails and deletes them.
         - It blocks the sender's IP address on the firewall.
         - It adds the malicious link to a blocklist.
      - **Response:** The SOAR platform creates an incident ticket, logs all the automated actions, and presents a complete report to the security analyst. The analyst can then quickly verify the actions, add notes, and officially close the incident.
      
20. **Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM)**: CAASM is an emerging approach in cybersecurity that helps organizations see and manage their entire collection of digital assets to identify security gaps and reduce their attack surface.

21.  **Crawl job**: A crawl job is a task given to an automated program, called a crawler or spider, to systematically browse and index content on the internet or within a specific network.

## Key Features

1.  **Normalize First Seen and Last Seen**\
    Standardizes asset observation timestamps across multiple data
    sources to improve asset lifecycle accuracy.

2.  **Mean Time to Repair Metrics for Vulnerabilities**\
    Calculates the average time taken to remediate vulnerabilities,
    helping track security posture and team efficiency.

3.  **Role‑Based Device Access Restriction**\
    Enforces RBAC policies to ensure only authorized roles can view or
    manage specific devices.

4.  **Vulnerability SA (Situational Awareness)**\
    Provides consolidated visibility into vulnerability posture across
    assets, environments, and tenants.

5.  **Non‑CVE Vulnerabilities Integration**\
    Supports ingestion and tracking of security issues that do not have
    CVE identifiers (e.g., vendor advisories, misconfigurations, policy
    violations).
